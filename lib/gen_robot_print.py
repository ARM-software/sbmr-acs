# In the following section of code, we will dynamically create print versions for several of the sprint
# functions defined above.  For example, where we have an sprint_vars() function defined above that returns
# formatted variable print outs in a string, we will create a corresponding rprint_vars() function that will
# print that string directly to stdout.

# It can be complicated to follow what's being created below.  Here is an example of the rprint_vars()
# function that will be created:

# def rprint_vars(*args, **kwargs):
#     gp.gp_print(gp.replace_passwords(sprint_vars(*args, **kwargs)), stream='stdout')

# For sprint_vars (defined above), the following functions will be created:

# rprint_vars                       Robot Print Vars
# rqprint_vars                      Robot Print Vars if ${quiet} is set to ${0}.
# rdprint_vars                      Robot Print Vars if ${debug} is set to ${1}.
# rlprint_vars                      Robot Print Vars to the log instead of to the console.

# Abbreviated names are created for all of the preceding function names:
# rpvars
# rqpvars
# rdpvars
# rlpvars

# Users are encouraged to only use the abbreviated forms for development but to then ultimately switch to
# full names.
